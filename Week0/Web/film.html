  <h2>Fight Club</h2>
  <em>Brad Pitt and Edward Norton</em> give a phenomenal performance in this movie about a man torn apart. Trying to find himself and who he wants to be, Edward Norton goes on a journey with Brad Pitt. A journey including many people, a woman, lots of fighting, and the art of making soap.<br>
  This is one of my favorite movies because it shows a very common struggle that most of us must go through. The struggle to become the person we want to be. In the journey of life, we often end up battling against ourselves to do the things we know we should or become a "better" person. There may be many errors and mistakes made along the way, but through it all, we end up finding out who we truly are.

<!-- Problems indenting the actor names w/o skipping a line. <p> did not work after changing CSS file because it also skips a line due to it's not inline nature.
	Also need a better understanding of organizing blocks so that I do not have to create a specific div with a position attribute *unless that is indeed how to do the assignment.
